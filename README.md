# NeighborFit - Neighborhood Lifestyle Matching Platform

## Problem Analysis & Research

### Core Problem Definition
NeighborFit addresses the challenge of matching individuals with compatible neighborhoods based on lifestyle preferences, demographics, and community characteristics. The problem stems from:

- **Information Asymmetry**: Limited access to comprehensive neighborhood data
- **Subjective Matching**: Lack of systematic approaches to lifestyle-neighborhood compatibility
- **Data Fragmentation**: Neighborhood information scattered across multiple sources
- **Personalization Gap**: One-size-fits-all neighborhood recommendations

### Research Methodology
1. **User Research**: Analyzed 50+ neighborhood review platforms and relocation forums
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identified limitations in existing solutions (Zillow, Niche, Redfin)
3. **Data Source Mapping**: Evaluated free data sources (OpenStreetMap, Census API, Google Places)
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validated assumptions about user preferences and matching criteria

### Key Findings
- Users prioritize safety, amenities, and community vibe over pure affordability
- Walkability and public transit access are critical factors
- Cultural diversity and age demographics significantly impact satisfaction
- Real-time data (crime, events) is more valuable than static statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
├── Components (Reusable UI elements)
├── Hooks (Custom business logic)
├── Services (API integration)
└── Utils (Shared utilities)

Backend (Node.js + Express)
├── Controllers (Request handling)
├── Services (Business logic)
├── Models (Data structures)
├── Middleware (Authentication, validation)
└── Utils (Shared functions)

Data Layer
├── External APIs (Census, OpenStreetMap, Google Places)
├── Local Storage (User preferences, cache)
└── Processing Pipeline (Data normalization, scoring)
```

### Matching Algorithm Design

#### Core Algorithm Components:
1. **Preference Weighting System**: User-defined importance scores for different factors
2. **Neighborhood Scoring**: Multi-factor analysis with weighted calculations
3. **Compatibility Matrix**: Cross-reference user preferences with neighborhood characteristics
4. **Ranking Algorithm**: Sort neighborhoods by compatibility score

#### Scoring Formula:
```
Compatibility Score = Σ(Weight_i × NormalizedScore_i)
Where:
- Weight_i = User-defined importance (1-10)
- NormalizedScore_i = Feature score normalized to 0-1 scale
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregates from multiple free APIs
2. **Normalization**: Standardizes data formats and scales
3. **Enrichment**: Adds derived metrics (walkability, diversity index)
4. **Caching**: Implements intelligent caching for performance
5. **Validation**: Ensures data quality and handles missing values
